    <h1>Everyday Git</h1>
    </div>
    <h2>What is Git?</h2>
    <p>Git is a free and open source distributed <em>version control system </em>
        designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.</p>
    <p><b>Version control systems</b> are a category of software tools that helps in recording 
        changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done in the code.
        By maintaining a history of changes, a <em>VCS</em> enables developers to manage their projects more efficiently,
         whether they are working alone or as part of a team.
        There are several version control systems available, such as <b>Subversion (SVN)</b>, <b>Mercurial</b>, 
        and <b>Perforce</b>, this blog will focus on Git.
        Git is widely used due to its distributed nature and robust feature set,
         making it a popular choice for developers around the globe.
        We will also explore GitHub, 
        a platform that integrates with Git to provide a collaborative environment for managing and
         sharing Git repositories.
        In this blog I will be diving deeper into how Git and GitHub work and 
        how they can enhance your development workflow.</p>

        <h3>Installing Git</h3>
        <p>To check if Git is already installed on your machine,open your terminal or command prompt and type <code>git --version</code>. 
            If Git is not installed, download the installer from
             the <b><a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">official Git website</a> </b> and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
            Once installed, verify the installation by running <code>git --version</code> <br>
            <img src="Images/version-git.JPG" alt="version of git installed"> <br>
            again to ensure Git is correctly set up on your system.</p>
        <h3>Configuring Git</h3>
        <p>Set up Git with your personal username and email address.</p>
        <h5>Follow the steps below:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Open your terminal or command prompt.</li>
            <li>Set your username by typing:
                 <br><b><em><code>git config --global user.name "Your Name"</code></em></b></li><br>    
                <img src="images/usernameg.JPG" alt="username configuration"><br><br>
            <li>Set your email address by typing: 
                <br> <b><em><code>git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"</em></b></code></li><br>
            <img src="images/emailg.JPG" alt="email configuration"><br><br>
            <li>Verify your configuration by running:
                <br><b><em><code>git config --global --list</code></em></b></li>
            <img src="images/list.JPG" alt="configuration image">
        </ol>

    <h3>Intializing a Git repository</h3>
        <p>To start using Git for your project, you need to initialize a Git repository. <br>
            This command creates a hidden <code>.git</code> directory in your project folder, 
            which contains all the necessary files for version control. Here’s how you do it:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to your project folder in the terminal or command prompt</li> <br>
            <li>Initialize the repository by <br> <b><em> <code>git init
            </code></em></b></li><br>
            <img src="images/inits.JPG" alt="git iniitialization">
            <li>Verify the repository setup by listing the contents :<br>
                 <b><em><code>ls -a</code></em></b></li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Adding files to the staging area</h3>
    <p>In Git, the staging area  is an intermediate space where you prepare your files before committing them to the repository. 
        It acts as a buffer between your working directory and the repository, 
        allowing you to review and organize changes before finalizing them.</p>
        <h5>Steps to Add Files to the Staging Area</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Check the status of your working directory to see which files are untracked or modified: <br>
            <b> <em> <code>git status
            </code></em></b> <br>
            <img src="images/status.JPG" alt="git status"> <br>
            This command will list files that have been changed but not yet added to the staging area</li>
            
            <li>Add files to the staging area by using: <br> <b> <em> <code>git add filename
            </code></em></b> <br> 
            <img src="images/filename.JPG" alt="add one filename"> <br> <br> or <br>
            Replace filename with the name of the file you want to stage.
             To add all files in the directory, you can use: <b>
                <em> <code>git add .
                </code></em>
             </b></li>
             <img src="images/add.JPG" alt="git add files"> <br>
             <li>Verify staged files by running: <br> b
             <em> <code>git status
            </code></em></li>
            <img src="images/status2.JPG" alt="git add">
        </ol>
    
    <h3>Commiting changes</h3> 
    <p>Committing changes is a fundamental step in using Git.
         A commit is like a snapshot of your project at a particular point in time. 
        It captures the state of your files in the staging area and records it in the repository's history.</p> <br>
        <h5>How to Commit Changes</h5>  <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Stage Your Changes: Before you can commit, you need to add your changes to the staging area.
                 <br> <b> <em><code>git add filename
                    <br>
                    <img src="images/filename.JPG" alt="filename"> <br>
            </code></em></b>Or add all changes: <b> <em> <code>git add .
            </code></em></b> <br> <br>
            <img src="images/add.JPG" alt=" add a file"><br>
            </li>
            <li>Commit Your Changes: To commit, use the following command:
                 <br> <b><em><code>git commit -m "Your commit message here"
            </code></em></b></li>
            <img src="images/commit.JPG" alt="commit message">
        </ol> 

    <h3>Branches</h3>    
    <p>In Git, a branch is like a separate workspace where you can make changes without affecting the main project. 
        Branches are important because they allow you to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Work Independently: Develop new features or fix bugs without disrupting the main code.</li>
            <li>Collaborate Efficiently: Multiple team members can work on different tasks simultaneously.</li>
            <li>Experiment Safely: Try out new ideas without risking the stability of your main project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Branches help keep your code organized and manageable, making development smoother and more collaborative.</p>
        <h4>Creating a branch</h4>
        <p>Creating a branch in Git allows you to work on a new feature or fix independently from the main codebase.</p>
        <h5>Here's how to create a new branch:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Open your terminal or command prompt.</li>
            <li>Create a new branch by typing: <br>
                 <b><em> <code>git branch branch_name
            </code></em></b> Replace branch_name with the name you want for your branch.</li>
           <img src="Images/newbranch.JPG" alt="new branch" >
            <li>Switch to the new branch by using: br <b> <em><code>git checkout branch_name
            </code></em></b> 
            <br> <br>
            <img src="images/checkout.JPG" alt="alt to switch"> <br>
            Alternatively, you can create and switch to the branch in one step with: <br> <b> <em> <code>git checkout -b branch_name
            </code></em></b></li> <br>
            <li>Verify your branch by running: <br> <b><em><code>git branch
            </code></em></b></li>
            <img src="images/branch.JPG" alt="verify branch you are in">
        </ol>

     <h4>Viewing all branches</h4>   
     <p>To manage your branches effectively, 
        you need to know how to view all branches in your repository and identify the currently active branch.
         Here’s how to do it:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>View All Branches: To see a list of all branches in your repository, use: <br>
            <b><em><code>git branch
            </code></em></b></li>
            <img src="images/branch.JPG" alt="view all branches"> <br>
            <li>View Remote Branches: If you want to see branches that exist on a remote repository, use: <br>
            <b><em><code>git branch -r
            </code></em></b></li>
            <img src="images/branchr.JPG" alt="view remote branches"> <br>
            <li>View Both Local and Remote Branches: To view all branches, both local and remote, use: <br>
            <b><em><code>git branch -a
            </code></em></b></li>
            <img src="images/brancha.JPG" alt="view both local and remote branches">

         </ol>

     <h4>Switching active branches</h4>    
     <p>Switching branches in Git allows you to move between different lines of development in your project.
         Here’s how you can change your active branch:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Open your terminal or command prompt.</li>
            <li>Switch to another branch by typing: <br>
            <b><em><code>git checkout branch_name
            </code></em></b> <br>
            <img src="images/checkout.JPG" alt="switch branch">
           </li>

            <li>Alternatively, use Git Switch (if available) for a simpler command: <br>
            <b><em><code>git switch branch_name
            </code></em></b> <br>
            <img src="images/switch.JPG" alt="switch branch">
        </li>

            <li>Verify the active branch by running: <br>
            <b><em><code>git branch
            </code></em></b> <br>
            <img src="images/branch.JPG" alt="git branch">
        </li>
         </ol>

     <h4>Merging a branch</h4>    
     <p>Merging branches in Git allows you to combine changes from one branch into another, 
        typically bringing updates from a feature branch into the main branch. 
        Here’s how to do it:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Switch to the branch you want to merge changes into. 
                For example, if you want to merge changes into the <code>main</code> branch, 
                first switch to it: <br> 
            <b><em> <code>git checkout main
            </code></em></b> <br>
            <img src="images/checkout.JPG" alt="git checkout">
        </li>

            <li>Merge the desired branch into your current branch. 
                For instance, to merge changes from <code>feature_branch</code> into <code>main</code>, use: <br>
            <b> <em><code>git merge feature_branch
            </code></em></b> <br>
            <img src="Images/merge.JPG" alt="merg">
        </li>

            <li>Resolve any conflicts if they arise. 
                Git will notify you of conflicts that need to be resolved manually before completing the merge.</li>

                <li>Commit the merge if there were conflicts resolved manually: <br>
                <b><em><code>git commit -m "Merged feature_branch into main"
                </code></em></b> <br>
                <img src="images/commitm.JPG" alt="git commit ">
            </li>
        </ol>

     <h4> Deleting a branch</h4>   
     <p>Deleting branches helps keep your repository clean by removing branches that are no longer needed.
         Here’s how to delete both local and remote branches:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Open your terminal or command prompt.</li>
            <li>Delete a local branch by typing: <br>
            <b><em><code>git branch -d branch_name
            </code></em></b> <br>
            <img src="Images/deleted.JPG" alt="git delete"> <br>
            The -d flag ensures the branch is only deleted if it has been fully merged.
             Use -D to force delete a branch, even if it hasn’t been merged: <br>
            <b><em><code>git branch -D branch_name
            </code></em></b> <br>
        <img src="Images/deleteDe.JPG" alt="git delete -D"></li>
            <li>Verify the deletion by running: <br>
            <b><em><code>git branch
            </code></em></b> <br> This command will list all remaining branches. <br>
            <img src="Images/master.JPG" alt="git branch "></li>
        </li>
           
         </ol>

     <h4>Pushing Changes to GitHub Using Git</h4>  
     <p>To push your local changes to a GitHub repository, follow these steps:</p> 
     <ol>
        <li>Ensure Your Local Repository Is Connected to GitHub
            First, make sure your local repository is linked to a GitHub repository.
             You can check this with: <br>
            <b><em><code>git remote -v
            </code></em></b> <br>
            <img src="Images/remoteV.JPG" alt="git remote -v"> <br>
            This command lists the remote repositories associated with your local repository.
             If you need to add a remote, use:
            <br> <b><em><code>git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
            </code></em></b> <br>
            <img src="Images/addRemote.JPG" alt=" git remote add origin">
        </li>
            <li>Stage and Commit Your Changes
                Before pushing, ensure you have committed your changes: <br>
            <b><em><code>git add .
            </code></em></b> <br>
            <img src="images/add.JPG" alt="git add"> <br>
            This stages all changes. Then commit them with:
        <br> <b><em><code>git commit -m "Your commit message"
        </code></em></b> <br>
        <img src="Images/commitE.JPG" alt="commit message">
    </li>
            <li>Push Changes to GitHub
                Push your committed changes to GitHub :<br>
                <b><em><code>git push origin branch_name
                </code></em></b> <br>
                <img src="Images/push.JPG" alt="push origin branch-name"> <br>
                Replace branch_name with the name of the branch you want to push to (e.g., main or master).
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Check your GitHub repository online to confirm that your changes have been uploaded.</li>
     </ol>
